### TODO: write a sell_pants method:

#    the object to the pants_sold attribute list
#
#    Args:

#    Returns:
#        None

### TODO: write a display_sales method:
#    
#    This method has no input or outputs. When this method 
#    is called, the code iterates through the pants_sold list
#    and prints out the characteristics of each pair of pants
#    line by line. The print out should look something like this
#
#   color: blue, waist_size: 34, length: 34, price: 10
#   color: red, waist_size: 36, length: 30, price: 14.15

#      in the total_sales attribute and then return the total.
#      
#      Args:
#        None
#      Returns:
#        float: total sales
